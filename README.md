These are just some of the kooky things I say from time to time. 

### Greetings (Purposefully misspelt where needed) 
- Sup yo?
- How you dooin?
- Sup Dog?
- Sup Lady?
- My Dog
- Sup Man?

FYI: Sup and My are for the most part interchangable. 

### Cursing 101
- SHIT SON!
- OH HELL NO!
- AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT!
- OHHHH SHIT!
- WELL SHIT!

FYI: Again, Well and OHHH are mostly interchangable 

### While coding (When I am confused)
- Why Casta, Why?
- You sonova beech
- I see what you did there
- What, what?

### General
- You know it son (Aggreeing with someone's point of view)
